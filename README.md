# Disable Chat Emails

Disables chat emails for all users in Discourse by bulk changing user preferences.

Every user's preferences are updated every 30 minutes to have chat emails disabled.

This is a temporary workaround until [this feature](https://meta.discourse.org/t/prevent-emailed-chat-notifications-when-invoked-via-sdk/308065) is available in Discourse.
